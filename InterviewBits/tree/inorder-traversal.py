"""
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodesâ€™ values.
Example :
Given binary tree
   1

   3
return [1,3,2].
Using recursion is not allowed

# How would it work if you were not allowed to change the tree but use additional memory

# How would it work if you were not even allowed the extra memory ?
