"""
Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodesâ€™ values. (ie, from left to right,
then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
Example :
Given binary tree
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return
[
         [3],
         [20, 9],
         [15, 7]
]

# We will be using 2 stacks to solve this problem. One for the current layer and other one for the next layer.
# Also keep a flag which indicates the direction of traversal on any level.
# You need to pop out the elements from current layer stack and depending upon the value of flag push the
# childs of current element in next layer stack. You should maintain the output sequence in the process as well.
# Remember to swap the stacks before next iteration. When should you terminate this algorithm?
