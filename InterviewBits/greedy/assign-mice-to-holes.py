"""
There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line.
Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.
A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1.
Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.
Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.
Example:
positions of mice are:
4 -4 2
positions of holes are:
4 0 5
Assign mouse at position x=4 to hole at position x=4 : Time taken is 0 minutes
Assign mouse at position x=-4 to hole at position x=0 : Time taken is 4 minutes
Assign mouse at position x=2 to hole at position x=5 : Time taken is 3 minutes
After 4 minutes all of the mice are in the holes.
Since, there is no combination possible where the last mouse's time is less than 4,
answer = 4.
Input:
A :  list of positions of mice
B :  list of positions of holes
Output:
single integer value
 NOTE: The final answer will fit in a 32 bit signed integer.

# Approach:
#
# sort mice positions (in any order)
# sort hole positions
# Loop i = 1 to N:
#     update ans according to the value of |mice(i) - hole(i)|
# Proof of correctness:
# Let i1 < i2 be the positions of two mice and let j1 < j2 be the positions of two holes.
# It suffices to show via case analysis that
# max(|i1 - j1|, |i2 - j2|) <= max(|i1 - j2|, |i2 - j1|) ,
#     where '|a - b|' represent absolute value of (a - b)
# since it follows by induction that every assignment can be transformed by a series of swaps into
# the sorted assignment, where none of these swaps increases the makespan

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def mice(self, a, b):
        return max(abs(i - j) for i, j in zip(sorted(a), sorted(b)))
