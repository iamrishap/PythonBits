"""
Given 2 non negative integers m and n, find gcd(m, n)
GCD of 2 integers m and n is defined as the greatest integer g such that g is a divisor of both m and n.
Both m and n fit in a 32 bit signed integer.
Example
m : 6
n : 9
GCD(m, n) : 3

# Lets say g is gcd(m, n) and m > n.
# m = g * m1
# n = g * m2
# m - n = g * (m1 - m2)
# gcd (m, n) = gcd(m-n, n)
# gcd (m, n) = gcd(m-n, n)
#            = gcd(m - 2n, n) if m >= 2n
#            = gcd(m - 3n, n) if m >= 3n
#              .
#              .
#              .
#            = gcd(m - k*n, n) if m >= k*n
# In other words, we keep subtracting n till the result is greater than 0. Ultimately we will end up with m % n.
# So gcd(m, n)  = gcd(m % n, n)
