"""
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
For example,
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list,
 only nodes itself can be changed.

# Lets first look at the problem of swapping 2 nodes.
# Method 1: Just swap the values in the 2 nodes. In most cases, this wonâ€™t be a permissible solution.
# Method 2: Move around the pointers.
