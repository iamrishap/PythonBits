Input Format
The only argument given is string A.
Output Format
Return an integer which is the integer verison of roman numeral string.
For Example
Input 1:
    A = "XIV"

# Note how the number XVI(10+5+1) and XIV(10-1+5) differs.
# In one case we are adding the numeric value of a letter and in other case we are subtracting it.
# How can you simulate this?
# The key is to notice that in a valid Roman numeral representation the letter
# with the most value always occurs at the start of the string.
# Whenever a letter with lesser value precedes a letter of higher value,
# it means its value has to be added as negative of that letterâ€™s value. In all other cases, the values get added.
