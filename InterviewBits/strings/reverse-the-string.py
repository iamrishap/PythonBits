"""
Given a string A.
Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.
NOTE:
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
Input Format
The only argument given is string A.
Output Format
Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.
For Example
Input 1:
    A = "the sky is blue"
Output 1:
    "blue is sky the"
Input 2:
    A = "this is ib"
Output 2:
    "ib is this"

# One simple approach is a two-pass solution:
# First pass to split the string by spaces into an array of words
# Then second pass to extract the words in reversed order
# We can do better in one-pass. While iterating the string in reverse order,
# we keep track of a wordâ€™s beginning and end position.
# When we are at the beginning of a word, we append it.
