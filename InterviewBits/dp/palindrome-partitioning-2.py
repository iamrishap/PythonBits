"""
Given a string A, partition A such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of A.
Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains the string A.
Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the answer as described in the problem statement.
Constraints:
1 <= length(A) <= 501
Examples:
Input 1:
    A = "aba"
Output 1:
    0
Explanation 1:
    "aba" is already a palindrome, so no cuts are needed.
Input 2:
    A = "aab"
Output 2:
    1
Explanation 2:
    Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
