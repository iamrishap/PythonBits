"""
Given a binary tree T, find the maximum path sum.
The path may start and end at any node in the tree.
Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains a pointer to the root of T, A.
Output Format:
Return an integer representing the maximum sum path.
Constraints:
1 <= Number of Nodes <= 7e4
-1000 <= Value of Node in T <= 1000
Example :
Input 1:
       1
      / \
     2   3
Output 1:
     6
Explanation 1:
    The path with maximum sum is: 2 -> 1 -> 3
Input 2:
       -10
       /  \
     -20  -30
Output 2:
    -10
Explanation 2
    The path with maximum sum is: -10

# There are several ways of looking at this problem.
# If we knew that root R is going to be a part of the longest path. Then we can look at the longest path to any
# leaf in the left subtree, longest path in the right subtree, and add them up along with rootâ€™s value to get the
# answer ( Obviously we only consider a path if its value is not negative ). To calculate the longest path till a leaf
# is O(n) [ Recursive call carrying forward the cumulative sum to a node ].
# Given N possible roots, and then the O(n) leaf path calculation, the bruteforce becomes O(n^2).
# However, note that the calculation of the longest path to the leaf is very redundant. So, to calculate the
# result for root R, can you reuse the results you have for R->left / R->right ?
