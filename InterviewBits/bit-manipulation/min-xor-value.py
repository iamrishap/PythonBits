"""
Given an array of N integers, find the pair of integers in the array which have minimum XOR value.
Report the minimum XOR value.
Examples :
Input
0 2 5 7
Output
2 (0 XOR 2)
Input
0 4 7 9
Output
3 (4 XOR 7)
Constraints:
2 <= N <= 100 000
0 <= A[i] <= 1 000 000 000

# The first step is to sort the array. The answer will be the minimal value of X[i] XOR X[i+1] for every i.
# Proof:
# Letâ€™s suppose that the answer is not X[i] XOR X[i+1], but A XOR B and there exists C in the array such as A <= C <= B.
# Next is the proof that either A XOR C or C XOR B are smaller than A XOR B.
# Let A[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of A
# Let B[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of B
# Let C[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of C
# This is with the assumption that all of A, B and C are padded with 0 on the left until they all have the same length
# Example: A=169, B=187, C=185
# A=101010012
# B=101110112
# C=101110012
# Let i be the leftmost (biggest) index such that A[i] differs from B[i]. There are 2 cases now:
# 1) C[i] = A[i] = 0,
# then (A XOR C)[i] = 0 and (A XOR B)[i] = 1
# This implies (A XOR C) < (A XOR B)
# 2) C[i] = B[i] = 1,
# then (B XOR C)[i] = 0 and (A XOR B)[i] = 1
# This implies (B XOR C) < (A XOR B)
# Time complexity: O(N * l)

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
