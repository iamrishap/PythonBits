"""
Given a N cross M matrix in which each row is sorted, find the overall median of the matrix. Assume N*M is odd.
For example,
Matrix=
[1, 3, 5]
[2, 6, 9]
[3, 6, 9]
A = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 9, 9]
Median is 5. So, we return 5.
Note: No extra memory is allowed.

# We cannot use extra memory, so we canâ€™t actually store all elements in an array and sort the array.
# But since, rows are sorted it must be of some use, right?
# Note that in a row you can binary search to find how many elements are smaller than a value X in O(log M).
# This is the base of our solution.
# Say k = N*M/2. We need to find (k + 1)^th smallest element.
# We can use binary search on answer. In O(N log M), we can count how many elements are smaller than X in the matrix.
# So, we use binary search on interval [1, INT_MAX]. So, total complexity is O(30 * N log M).
# Note:
# This problem can be solve by using min-heap, but extra memory is not allowed.
